# CDS Experimental Standards

## Introduction

These standards are developed by the Data Standards Body to support the creation
of [Consumer Data Standards](https://consumerdatastandards.gov.au/) for the
[Consumer Data Right](https://treasury.gov.au/consumer-data-right) regime in
Australia.

These standards are experimental.  This means that they are unstable and are
expected to be decommissioned at some time in the future.  They have been
created for the purposes of testing concepts and facilitating consultation.

If an experimental standard is seen to be valid and useful it will be
decommissioned and reformatted as a draft standard on the
[main consumer data standards repository](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards/issues).

## Community Contributions

Contributions are welcome to these standards and can be provided via the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards-experimental)
holding these standards.  The README for this repository outlines the process
for contribution and moderation of these standards.
