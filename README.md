# Consumer Data Right - Experimental Standards

This repository contains experimental data standards created in response to the [Consumer Data Right](https://treasury.gov.au/consumer-data-right) legislation and the subsequent regulatory rules.  The purpose of the Consumer Data Right regime is to give Australians greater control over their data and is intended to apply sector by sector across the whole Australian economy.

These standards are maintained by the Data Standards Body (DSB) and are considered experimental only.  The Data Standards Body is part of the [Treasury](https://www.directory.gov.au/portfolios/treasury/data-standards-body). The work of standards development is conducted in consultation with the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0) as co-regulator of the Consumer Data Right, along with the [Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)](https://www.oaic.gov.au/consumer-data-right/about-the-consumer-data-right/).

These standards are experimental.  This means that they are unstable and are expected to be decommissioned at some time in the future.  They have been created for the purposes of testing concepts and facilitating consultation.

If an experimental standard is seen to be valid and useful it will be decommissioned and reformatted as a draft standard on the [main consumer data standards repository](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards/issues).

## Viewing The Experimental Standards

The experimental standards are [published here](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards-experimental/).

## Contributing To The Experimental Standards

Consultation on the standards as they evolve is performed transparently with any interested contributor invited to participate in accordance with the rules of engagement described below.

## The Consumer Data Standards

These standards are not the binding standards created for the Consumer Data Right.  The binding standards can be found in the [main consumer data standards repository](https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards/issues).

## Rules of engagement for this repository

We're committed to undertaking conversations relating to the technical standards in the open. Questions or comments that participants might ask us via email or private message are likely to be questions or comments other participants have as well. Our answers will be of interest to everyone. There are likely to be experiences and lessons everybody working in this ecosystem can learn from. Having these conversations transparently helps us reduce duplication, resolve issues faster and keep everyone up to date with the conversation.

We ask that all contributors to the Consumer Data Standards repositories comply with the [GitHub Community Forum Code of Conduct](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-forum-code-of-conduct/).

In addition, it would be appreciated if the following rules are adhered to when commenting or contributing:
* Please provide a single, considered response to each proposal covering all feedback concerning the proposal.
* For transparency, if you work at or are associated with an organisation with an interest in the standards, please indicate this in your response.
* Please ensure you are aware of and compliant with any social media guidelines or internal processes for response set by your organisation before providing feedback.
* Please refrain from initiating new issues or pull requests in this repository due to the need for formal approval of all aspects of the standards
